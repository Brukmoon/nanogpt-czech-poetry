"""
Poor Man's Configurator. Probably a terrible idea. Example usage:
$ python train.py config/override_file.py --batch_size=32
this will first run config/override_file.py, then override batch_size to 32

The code in this file will be run as follows from e.g. train.py:
>>> exec(open('configurator.py').read())

So it's not a Python module, it's just shuttling this code away from train.py
The code in this script then overrides the globals()

I know people are not going to love this, I just really dislike configuration
complexity and having to prepend config. to every single variable. If someone
comes up with a better simple Python solution I am all ears.
